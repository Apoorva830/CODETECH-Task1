# Overview of the Project

### Project: Creating a basic simple Calculator

![Screenshot 2024-12-09 162248](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3870b5ac-a70e-4029-a36b-6a126510aded)


### Objective
-Enable users to carry out basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and advanced operations (exponentiation, modulus).
-Provide an interactive command-line interface that guides users through the input and operation selection process.
-Implement robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and operations gracefully.
-Calculation History: Maintain a history of all calculations performed during the session for user reference.

### Key Activities

-Prompt users to enter two numeric values.
-Validate inputs to ensure they are numeric.
-Display a menu of available mathematical operations.
-Allow users to select an operation by entering a corresponding number.
-Execute the selected operation on the input numbers.
-Handle special cases such as division by zero.
-Show the result of the calculation in a clear format.
-Provide feedback on invalid selections or operations.
-Store each calculation in a history list.
-Display the history at the end of the session.
-Allow users to exit the program gracefully while displaying their calculation history.

### Technologies used
-Programming Language: Python.
     -Utilizes Python's built-in capabilities for handling user input, performing calculations, and managing data structures (lists).
-Development Environment: Any text editor or IDE that supports Python (e.g., PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or even a simple text editor with terminal access).
-Command-Line Interface (CLI): The application runs in a terminal or command prompt, providing an interactive experience without the need for a graphical userinterface (GUI).

### Code Structure
-Functions
     modulus(x, y): Returns x mod y.
     Additional functions for arithmetic operations should be defined (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, divide). 

### Key Insights
-User Experience: The program is designed with user experience in mind, providing clear instructions and feedback throughout the interaction.
-Error Handling: Robust error handling ensures that invalid inputs do not crash the program and provides informative messages instead.
-Extensibility: The modular design allows for easy addition of more mathematical functions or features in future iterations.
-Educational Value: This project serves as a practical example for beginners learning Python programming concepts such as functions, control flow, and data management.

### Conclusion
-The Advanced Calculator project is a useful tool for performing various mathematical computations while maintaining a history of calculations for user reference. It serves as both an educational exercise in Python programming and a functional utility that can be further enhanced with additional features.
